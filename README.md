Car Price Prediction with Python:

This project applies Machine Learning techniques to predict the selling price of cars based on their features such as age, mileage, fuel type, transmission, brand, and engine specifications. By analyzing historical car price data, the model helps in estimating the fair market value of used cars.

Project Overview:

The main goals of this project are:

To load and preprocess a car price dataset.

To explore relationships between car features and prices.

To train machine learning models for car price prediction.

To evaluate model performance and accuracy.

To make predictions for new/unseen data.

Dataset Information:

The dataset generally includes the following features (may vary based on source):

Car_Name → Name of the car

Year → Manufacturing year

Selling_Price → Price the car is being sold at (target variable)

Present_Price → Current showroom price

Driven_kms → Total distance driven

Fuel_Type → Petrol/Diesel/CNG

Seller_Type → Dealer or Individual

Transmission → Manual/Automatic

Owner → Number of previous owners

Dataset size: varies depending on source

Technologies Used:

Python 3

Libraries:

numpy → numerical computations

pandas → data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn → data visualization

scikit-learn → ML model training & evaluation

jupyter → running notebooks

Steps Involved:

Data Collection

Load dataset (CSV or Excel).

Data Preprocessing

Handle missing values.

Encode categorical variables (fuel type, transmission, seller type).

Feature scaling if required.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Correlation analysis between features and car price.

Visualization of numeric and categorical features.

Model Building

Train models such as:

Linear Regression

Decision Tree Regressor

Random Forest Regressor

XGBoost (optional)

Model Evaluation

Metrics: R² Score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE).

Compare performance of models.

Prediction

Test with new input data (car details).

How to Run:

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/car-price-prediction.git
cd car-price-prediction


Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the notebook:

jupyter notebook car_price_prediction.ipynb

Results & Insights:

Car price is strongly influenced by car age, mileage, fuel type, and transmission.

Random Forest Regressor and XGBoost give the best performance compared to Linear Regression.

The model achieves high accuracy with R² close to 0.9+ on test data.

Applications:

Helps car dealers estimate fair selling price.

Useful for customers to check if they are overpaying for a car.

Can be integrated into a web app (Flask/Streamlit) for real-time predictions.
